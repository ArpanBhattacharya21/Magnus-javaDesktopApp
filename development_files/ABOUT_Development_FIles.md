<h1>ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT FILES FOLDER</h2>
The folder cmonsists of all the internal Netbeans Development files. All these zip files in this folder is needed to be unzipped and kept in one single folder for netbeans to access it.
<br>
Folder names <strong>Java_Files(Preview)</strong> is made for those who wants to quickly review my code instead of opening it in netbeans, so I separated the .java files for such ourpose.
